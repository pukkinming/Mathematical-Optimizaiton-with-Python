# Mathematical Optimization with Python

This repo is to hold my Python code of solving mathematical optimization formulations. <br/><br/>
Formulations include:
- [linear programming](./LP/LP_final.ipynb)
- [mixed integer programming](./MIP/MIP_final.ipynb)
- [set covering - installing security telephones](./Set%20Covering/Installing%20Security%20Telephones.ipynb)
- [production planning and inventory control](./Inventory%20Control/Production%20Planning%20and%20Inventory%20Control.ipynb)
- [assign points to different groups to minimize regression MSE](./MIP/Assign%20points%20to%20different%20groups%20to%20minimize%20regression%20MSE.ipynb)

Besides, following are links to some good tutorial on Cplex with Python:
- [Tutorial: Linear Programming, (CPLEX Part 1)](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/html/Linear_Programming.html)
- [Tutorial: Beyond Linear Programming, (CPLEX Part 2)](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/html/Beyond_Linear_Programming.html)
- [CPLEX Optimization Modeling using Python](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27042869&aid=1)

Google offers its own [optimization tool](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) too.
