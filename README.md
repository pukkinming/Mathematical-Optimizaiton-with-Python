# Mathematical Optimization with Python

This repo is to hold my Python code of solving mathematical optimization formulations. <br/><br/>
Formulations include:
- [linear programming](./LP/LP_final.ipynb)
- [mixed integer programming](./MIP/MIP_final.ipynb)
- [set covering - installing security telephones](./Set%20Covering/Installing%20Security%20Telephones.ipynb)
